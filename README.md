# PointCloudWorkshop-June2017

## Description
This course will explore the acquisition, post-processing, and classification of point clouds derived from airborne and terrestrial lidar scanners and structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry from drones. The course will take place at campus Golm (UP) and includes one day of field-data collection and two days of data post-processing and analysis (June 7-9, 2017).
We will meet on June 7th at 9am in Haus 27 (Institute of Earth and Environmental Science), room 1.10.
